# mui-bookings
A toy prototype for a booking calendar SPA using Next.js, Firebase, and MaterialUI. This is a Next.js project bootstrapped with `create-next-app`.

### Live demo available
A demo of this SPA is deployed using Vercel. This can be accessed at mui-bookings.vercel.app.

## Running locally in development mode
To get started, just clone the repository and run `npm install && npm run dev`:

```
git clone https://github.com/jpin27/mui-bookings.git
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Active development
I am currently working on implementing full CRUD functionality for this app. The list of things I will be implementing can be seen from the issue tracker.
